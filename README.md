# connection_Mongodb.js
Hereâ€™s a rephrased and spell-checked version of the paragraph:  
"Start by installing MongoDB Compass, Second Step install MongoDB Shell (note: these instructions are for Windows). Then, use the file named `connection_mongodb` to connect the MongoDB database with your JavaScript files."

# index.js
"The `index.js` file serves as the main entry point of the project. It utilizes the `fs` module for file handling, integrates Express, and imports functions from the `connection_Mongodb` file. Additionally, it incorporates other modules, such as middleware (plugins) and routers, to perform CRUD operations on various routes."

# index_middleware.js
"Using middleware in this context involves utilizing the fs module for file handling and implementing a function named logResResponse to handle requests, responses, and check for any occurring errors."
